# Priority
-- Be with someone who Prioritizes you, no matter how busy they are, rather than giving excuses, "they find ways to be with you".

-- Be with someone who believes in your dreams, goals and constantly pushes me to work harder. "Its better to be alone than with wrong partner".

- If Ira raining heavily you can't run away from it. 
- You will get wet.
- So either you look for some shade.
-- Or tell yourself "I will get wet. But that dosen't mean I won't get dry again."

- Life is like that.
- Replace rain with problems and the approach remains the same.
