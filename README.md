# Priority
-- Be with someone who Prioritizes you, no matter how busy they are, rather than giving excuses, "they find ways to be with you".

-- Be with someone who believes in your dreams, goals and constantly pushes me to work harder. "Its better to be alone than with wrong partner".

- If Ira raining heavily you can't run away from it. 
- You will get wet.
- So either you look for some shade.
-- Or tell yourself "I will get wet. But that dosen't mean I won't get dry again."

- Life is like that.
- Replace rain with problems and the approach remains the same.

# Lauren Aquilina – You Can Be King Again
If you’re lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

And you don't have to be afraid
You're not gonna lose your way
And if you feel like you're alone in this world
You don't have to be alone in this world
You can be king again
```
